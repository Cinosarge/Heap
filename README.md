# Heap
Heap is an Android english dictionary aimed at helping you learn english.

## Heap is not a common dictionary
It was born to help you learn
- self-tailored: initially empty, you build your dictionary based upon your needs: just search for a word or create your own definition
- offline: it automatically searches Wikipedia Wictionary to fetch definitions and stores them locally in alphabetical order

## Layman instructions: how to get the app
If you want to use my app just download the installer (Heap.apk) on your phone, enable installation for non trusted third party applications and run the the installer. It's not a safe practice but you can alwasy trust Cinosarge. I hope I'll get to have my app on the store soon.

# Tecnical notes

## Contribution
If you wish to contribute or just get the code, this is an Android Studio Project. You know what to do!

## Features to come
- Make the UI look COOL and AMAZING
- Add a TTS funcionality to get the words pronunciation
- Add an import/export activity
- Add a settings activity including
-- a setting to change the language to search for (this implies memorizing the word language for the purpose of correct pronunciation)

## Bugs to fix and things to better
- The EditText fields do not scroll!
- Use a better way to extract definitions rather than downloading the web page and navigate the tree.

## Please be a dude
If I'm making any copyright infringement please be a dude: let me know and I'll fix it.
